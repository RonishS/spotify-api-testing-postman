# Spotify API Testing Project

## What I Built
As a QA enthusiast exploring API testing, I created this project to:
- Practice authenticating with Spotify's OAuth 2.0
- Validate CRUD operations on real-world APIs
- Learn dynamic data handling in Postman

**Key components**:
- Authentication workflow implementation
- 5 core API endpoints tested
- validation checks
- Real-world verification in Spotify app

## Project Walkthrough
- Importing collection
- Running one test
- Showing Spotify verification


## How to Validate My Work
1. Import collection to your Postman
2. Try to break these tests:
   - Remove authentication from a request
   - Change valid track ID to invalid one
   - Modify playlist ID during update

## Future Improvements
- Add rate limiting tests
- Test playlist collaboration features
- Implement CI/CD with Newman
