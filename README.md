# Spotify API Testing Project

## Project Walkthrough
- Importing collection
- Running one test
- Showing Spotify verification


## How to Validate My Work
1. Import collection to your Postman
2. Try to break these tests:
   - Remove authentication from a request
   - Change valid track ID to invalid one
   - Modify playlist ID during update

## Future Improvements
- Add rate limiting tests
- Test playlist collaboration features
- Implement CI/CD with Newman
